# Lyrical-GraphQL

GraphQL tutorial code from Stephen Grider's course on Udemy. Focused on client-side querying, integrating React with Apollo.

This tutorial introduced me to the basics of using Apollo to formulate GraphQL queries from within a React app. ApolloProvider, ApolloClient, and gql-tag were all used. The code here was copied by me as I followed along the tutorial, and will be useful to me in future both as boilerplate code to be copy-pasted and as a conceptual reference for constructing a React web app with GraphQL.
